# Example Data

The files in this directory are **example datasets** used to demonstrate the
serology-imputation pipeline.

- IDs are synthetic.
- Data are non-identifiable.
- These files are already available in a public repository associated with a
  submitted publication.
- No real patient data are included.

The examples preserve realistic missingness patterns (e.g., MNAR) to illustrate
pipeline behavior under practical conditions.
